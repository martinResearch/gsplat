gsplat is an open-source library for CUDA accelerated rasterization of gaussians with python bindings. It is inspired by the SIGGRAPH paper [3D Gaussian Splatting for Real-Time Rendering of Radiance Fields](https://repo-sam.inria.fr/fungraph/3d-gaussian-splatting/), but we’ve made gsplat even faster, more memory efficient, and with a growing list of new features!

## News

[Jan 2026] [PPIPS](https://research.nvidia.com/labs/sil/projects/ppisp/) is integreated as an alternative way of bilateral grid to compensate the training views.

[May 2025] Arbitrary batching (over multiple scenes and multiple viewpoints) is supported now!! Checkout [here](docs/batch.md) for more details! Kudos to [Junchen Liu](https://junchenliu77.github.io/).

[May 2025] [Jonathan Stephens](https://x.com/jonstephens85) makes a great [tutorial video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACPTiP98Pf8) for Windows users on how to install gsplat and get start with 3DGUT.

[April 2025] [NVIDIA 3DGUT](https://research.nvidia.com/labs/toronto-ai/3DGUT/) is now integrated in gsplat! Checkout [here](docs/3dgut.md) for more details. [[NVIDIA Tech Blog]](https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/revolutionizing-neural-reconstruction-and-rendering-in-gsplat-with-3dgut/) [[NVIDIA Sweepstakes]](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/research/3dgut-sweepstakes/)

## Installation

**Dependence**: Please install [Pytorch](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) first.

The easiest way is to install from PyPI. In this way it will build the CUDA code **on the first run** (JIT).

```bash
pip install gsplat
```

Alternatively you can install gsplat from source. In this way it will build the CUDA code during installation.

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/nerfstudio-project/gsplat.git
```
To build gsplat from source on Windows, please check [this instruction](docs/INSTALL_WIN.md).

We also provide pre-compiled wheels for Linux and Windows on Python 3.10–3.13 with PyTorch 2.3–2.6 and CUDA 11.x/12.x. See [docs/INSTALL_PRECOMPILED.md](docs/INSTALL_PRECOMPILED.md) for the full list and instructions. Quick example for CUDA 12.x:

**Python 3.10 – 3.12:**
```
pip install ninja numpy jaxtyping rich
pip install gsplat --index-url https://docs.gsplat.studio/whl/pt23to26.cu12
```
**Python 3.13:**
```
pip install ninja numpy jaxtyping rich
pip install gsplat --index-url https://docs.gsplat.studio/whl/pt26.cu12
```

## Evaluation

This repo comes with a standalone script that reproduces the official Gaussian Splatting with exactly the same performance on PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS, and converged number of Gaussians. Powered by gsplat’s efficient CUDA implementation, the training takes up to **4x less GPU memory** with up to **15% less time** to finish than the official implementation. Full report can be found [here](https://docs.gsplat.studio/main/tests/eval.html).

```bash
cd examples
pip install -r requirements.txt
# download mipnerf_360 benchmark data
python datasets/download_dataset.py
# run batch evaluation
bash benchmarks/basic.sh
```
